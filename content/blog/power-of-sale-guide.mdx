Receiving a Notice of Sale under Mortgage (power of sale notice) is one of the most stressful experiences a homeowner can face. In Ontario, power of sale is the legal process that allows mortgage lenders to sell your property to recover money owed when you've defaulted on your mortgage payments.

This comprehensive guide explains everything you need to know about power of sale in Ontario, your rights as a homeowner, and the options available to protect your interests and equity.

## Understanding Power of Sale in Ontario

Power of sale is different from foreclosure. In a power of sale:

- The lender sells your property but you retain legal ownership until the sale
- You're entitled to any surplus proceeds after the mortgage and costs are paid
- The process is generally faster than foreclosure (35-60 days vs. 6+ months)
- You have specific rights and redemption periods

### When Can Lenders Initiate Power of Sale?

Lenders can start power of sale proceedings when:

- You're in default on mortgage payments (usually 15+ days overdue)
- You've breached other mortgage terms (property taxes, insurance, etc.)
- The mortgage contains a power of sale clause (most do in Ontario)

## The Power of Sale Timeline

### Notice of Sale Under Mortgage (35 days)

This is your first formal notice that power of sale proceedings have begun. The notice must include:

- The amount you owe
- Your right to redeem the mortgage
- Your right to sell the property yourself
- Your right to receive surplus proceeds

### Redemption Period (35 days)

During this period, you can stop the power of sale by:

- **Full Redemption:** Paying the entire mortgage balance plus costs
- **Bringing Current:** Paying all arrears plus legal costs (if mortgage allows)
- **Negotiating:** Working out a payment plan with your lender

### Notice of Final Redemption (Additional 10 days)

If you don't redeem during the initial period, you get one final 10-day notice before the sale can proceed.

### Property Sale

After all notice periods expire, the lender can sell your property through:

- Public auction
- Private sale
- Real estate agent listing

## Your Rights During Power of Sale

### Right to Redeem

You can stop the power of sale at any time before the property is sold by paying:

- All mortgage arrears
- Legal costs and fees
- Interest and penalties

### Right to Sell

You have the right to sell the property yourself during the notice periods. This often results in a higher sale price than a power of sale.

### Right to Surplus Proceeds

If the property sells for more than you owe, you're entitled to the difference minus:

- Outstanding mortgage balance
- Legal fees and costs
- Real estate fees
- Property taxes and utilities in arrears

### Right to Occupancy

You can generally remain in the property until it's sold, unless you abandon it or are evicted for other reasons.

## Options to Stop or Delay Power of Sale

### 1. Bring Your Mortgage Current

The simplest solution if you have access to funds:

- Pay all missed payments plus penalties
- Cover legal costs incurred by the lender
- Resume regular mortgage payments

### 2. Mortgage Modification

Work with your lender to modify your mortgage terms:

- Extend the amortization period to lower payments
- Switch from accelerated to monthly payments
- Add arrears to the principal balance
- Temporary payment reduction or deferral

### 3. Refinance with a New Lender

If you have sufficient equity:

- Private lenders may refinance even with poor credit
- Higher interest rates but stops power of sale
- Buys time to improve your financial situation
- Consider this carefully due to higher costs

### 4. Sell the Property Yourself

Often the best option to maximize your equity:

- You control the sale process and timeline
- Typically achieve higher sale prices than power of sale
- Can negotiate closing dates that work for you
- Preserve your credit rating vs. completed power of sale

### 5. Cash Sale to Investors

When you need to sell quickly:

- Can close in 7-14 days
- No financing conditions to worry about
- Purchase "as-is" without repairs
- Certainty of closing vs. traditional buyers

## Protecting Your Equity

### Understanding Market Value

Power of sale properties often sell below market value because:

- Limited marketing time and exposure
- Motivated seller situation is obvious to buyers
- Properties may be in poor condition due to deferred maintenance
- Buyers factor in risks and unknowns

### Why Selling Yourself Usually Nets More Money

Even a quick private sale typically generates more proceeds than power of sale:

- Better marketing and presentation
- More time to find qualified buyers
- Ability to negotiate terms
- Lower legal and administrative costs

## Impact on Your Credit and Future

### Credit Rating Consequences

A completed power of sale will:

- Significantly damage your credit score
- Remain on your credit report for 6+ years
- Make future mortgage approval much more difficult
- Affect your ability to rent quality properties

### Deficiency Judgments

If the power of sale doesn't cover what you owe:

- The lender may sue you for the shortfall
- This debt survives the power of sale
- Can affect your wages and other assets
- May push you toward bankruptcy

## Special Situations

### Multiple Mortgages

If you have second mortgages or lines of credit:

- First mortgage holder controls the power of sale
- Second mortgage holders may be paid from surplus (if any)
- Junior lenders may try to stop the sale to protect their interests
- Complex legal situations may arise

### Joint Ownership

When property is owned by multiple people:

- All owners are typically liable for the mortgage
- One owner's bankruptcy doesn't protect the others
- Non-defaulting owners may have options to assume the mortgage
- Legal advice is crucial in these situations

### Matrimonial Home

If the property is a matrimonial home:

- Both spouses have rights regardless of whose name is on title
- Court approval may be required for sale
- Family law considerations overlap with mortgage enforcement
- Urgent legal advice is needed

## Getting Professional Help

### When to Hire a Lawyer

You should consult a lawyer immediately if:

- You receive a Notice of Sale Under Mortgage
- You believe the lender hasn't followed proper procedures
- You want to challenge the amount claimed
- There are complex ownership or family law issues
- You're considering bankruptcy as an option

### Working with Mortgage Brokers

Experienced mortgage brokers can help with:

- Finding refinancing options
- Negotiating with existing lenders
- Exploring private lending solutions
- Structuring deals that work for your situation

### Real Estate Professionals

If selling is your best option:

- Choose agents experienced with distressed sales
- Consider cash buyers who can close quickly
- Get realistic market assessments
- Understand all costs involved in selling

## Preventing Future Power of Sale

### Early Warning Signs

Take action before you miss mortgage payments if you notice:

- Difficulty making payments on time
- Having to choose between mortgage and other bills
- Relying on credit cards for basic expenses
- Job loss or income reduction
- Major unexpected expenses

### Proactive Communication

Contact your lender immediately if you anticipate problems:

- Lenders prefer to work with borrowers who communicate early
- More options are available before you're in default
- Shows good faith effort to resolve issues
- May preserve your credit rating

## Conclusion

Power of sale is a serious legal process, but you have rights and options. The key is acting quickly and getting proper advice. In many cases, selling your property yourself - even in a distressed situation - will preserve more of your equity than allowing the power of sale to proceed.

Remember that every situation is unique, and the sooner you take action, the more options you'll have available.
